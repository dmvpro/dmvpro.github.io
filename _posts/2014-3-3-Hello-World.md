title: Welcome to my blog!

This blog serves as an outlet for my data science projects and research. The blog might potentially be cross-hosted on a private domain but for now it resides here on github.

Things to do:  
* Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below):

  ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

  The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

* Add a theme to blog

* Create a blog post regarding Project Benson, an investigation into dynamic pricing opportunities for the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority.  Summarize problem statement, data munging, data analysis, and key takeaways. Include a link to the original proposal.

* Previous Projects

* Add CV, links to LinkedIn, github, pictures

* Move to WordPress or Squarespace
