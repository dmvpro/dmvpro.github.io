<p>I spent quite a bit of time in New York City MTA Subway from 2005-2007. The MTA is certainly the largest and most heavily trafficked public transportation system in this country and as such, must also be the source of quite a lot of data.  It's not a huge stretch to imagine that my first Data Science project would focus on turnstile data provided on the <a href=http://web.mta.info/developers/>MTA developer site</a>.

<p>With the help of my VeKeJoDa partners in my cohort, I outlined the problem facing the MTA. The MTA is faced with this proposed fare hike cycling every two years. The current flat fare is $2.75 with a proposed $0.25 increase scheduled in March 2017. But the MTA is one of the few 24-hour public transit agencies in the country, and as such must deal with peak demand spikes. Our proposal to the problem of charging riders a flat fare for service experiencing such dramatic spikes would be to implement a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pricing>dynamically priced</a> fare reduction in off-peak hours. We believed that encouraging riders to ride during off-peak hours would help alleviate congestion, improve customer satisfaction and generate revenue.

<p>The data on the MTA developer site included rough entry and exit counters for each subway station bucketed in four hour intervals at inconsistent times, and sometimes counting in reverse sequence. As to be expected, most of the project preparation required the munging and cleaning and reformatting of the data into a very useful format.

<p><ol>We proposed the following to the fictional client:
<li>An identification of the off-peak hours and days we proposed for farereduction:  8:00pm - 8:00am, Sunday - Saturday
<li>Encourage ridership during off-peak hours via fare reduction from $3.00 to $2.50
<li>Propose economics of fare reduction</ol>
