<p>MTA Turnstile Analysis and Proposal

<p>I spent quite a bit of time in New York City riding the MTA Subway from 2005-2007. The MTA is certainly the largest and most heavily trafficked public transportation system in this country and as such, must also be the source of an enormity of data.  It's not a huge stretch to imagine that my first Data Science project would focus on turnstile data provided on the <a href=http://web.mta.info/developers/>MTA developer site</a>.

<p>With the help of my VeKeJoDa partners in our cohort, I outlined the problem facing the MTA. The MTA is faced with a proposed fare hike cycling every two years. The current flat fare is $2.75 with a proposed $0.25 increase scheduled in March 2017. Considering the MTA is one of the few 24-hour public transit agencies in the country, they operate with peak demand spikes during rush hour versus off-peak valleys at night. Our proposal would be to implement a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pricing>dynamically priced</a> fare reduction in off-peak hours. We believe that encouraging riders to ride during off-peak hours would help alleviate congestion, improve customer satisfaction and generate revenue.

<p>The data on the MTA developer site included roughly-collected entry and exit counters for each subway station bucketed in four hour intervals at inconsistent times, and sometimes counting in reverse sequence. As to be expected, most of the project preparation required the munging and cleaning and reformatting of the data into a very useful format.

<p><ol>We proposed the following to the fictional client:
<li>An identification of the off-peak hours and days we proposed for fare reduction:  8:00pm - 8:00am, Sunday - Saturday
<li>Encourage ridership during off-peak hours via fare reduction from $3.00 to $2.50
<li>Propose economics of fare reduction</ol>
